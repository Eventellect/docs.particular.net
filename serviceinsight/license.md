There are multuple ways to add a license to ServiceInsight.

## Via the ServiceInsight UI

If the trial period has expired expires, the following dialog is displayed when running ServiceInsight:

The license can be loaded by clicking the "Browse..." button and selecting the license file. The dialog box will then display the following confirmation message:
