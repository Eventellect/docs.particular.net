[CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) is a [specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md) for describing event data in a common way. CloudEvents seeks to dramatically simplify event declaration and delivery across services, platforms, and beyond.

NServiceBus currently does not natively support CloudEvents.

We are currently capturing requirements to understand customer needs regarding CloudEvents.
If you are interested in helping us shape how NServiceBus should support CloudEvents, drop us a comment in [this](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/7159) GitHub issue.
