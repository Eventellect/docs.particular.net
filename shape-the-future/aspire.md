[.NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview) is an opinionated, cloud ready stack for building observable, production ready, distributed applications.â€‹

NServiceBus endpoints can run under an Aspire AppHost orchestrator, we have a sample that shows you how it all works.

But I am sure we can do much more, and this is where you come in and tell us how would you like NServiceBus to be even more integrated with the .NET Aspire orchestrator framework.
So if you have a spare moment to help us shape how NServiceBus should support Aspire, drop us a comment in [this](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/xxx) GitHub issue.
