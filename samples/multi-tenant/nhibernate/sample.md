This sample demonstrates how to configure NHibernate persistence to store tenant-specific data in separate catalogs for each tenant. The tenant-specific information includes saga state and business entities that are accessed using [NServiceBus-managed session](/persistence/nhibernate/accessing-data.md).

This sample uses [Outbox](/nservicebus/outbox/) to guarantee consistency between the saga state and the business entity. Outbox and timeout data are stored in a dedicated catalog shared by all tenants.

The sample assumes the tenant information is passed as a custom message header `tenant_id`.

## Prerequisites

include: sql-prereq

The databases created by this sample are:

 * `NHibernateMultiTenantReceiver`
 * `NHibernateMultiTenantA`
 * `NHibernateMultiTenantB`

include: persistence-running

include: persistence-code

#### Creating the schema

The default NHibernate persistence installers create all schema objects in a single catalog. In a multi-tenant scenario, schema objects need to be created manually. The `ScriptGenerator` class provides APIs required to generate schema creation scripts.

snippet: CreateSchema

The above code ensures that business entity and saga tables are created in the tenant databases while the timeouts and outbox are in the shared database.

Because the outbox table is stored in the shared catalog, the NHibernate persistence cannot access it when using the tenant connection string. Synonyms (a feature of SQL Server) provide a way to solve this problem. The following code creates synonyms for the `OutboxRecord` table in both tenant databases. These synonyms instruct the query processor to use the outbox table in the shared database whenever it encounters a reference to `OutboxRecord`.

snippet: Synonyms

#### Configuring NHibernate persistence to recognize business entities

To be able to use [NServiceBus-managed session](/persistence/nhibernate/accessing-data.md) to retrieve and store business entities, the NHibernate configuration used by NServiceBus needs to be appropriately configured.

#### Connecting to the tenant database

To allow database isolation between tenants, the connection to the database needs to be created based on the message being processed. This requires the cooperation of two components:

 * A behavior that inspects an incoming message and extracts the tenant's information 
 * A custom `ConnectionProvider` for NHibernate

The custom connection provider has to be registered with NHibernate

snippet: ConnectionProvider

The behavior retrieves the value of the `tenant_id` header and builds a connection string based on the header value. Then it stores the connection string in the async context via `AsyncLocal`.

snippet: PutConnectionStringToContext

The behavior has to be registered in the pipeline configuration

snippet: ExtractTenantConnectionStringBehavior

When NHibernate needs to open a connection, the custom connection provider retrieves the connection string value from the async context and, if present, opens a connection to the tenant database. Otherwise, it opens a connection to the shared database.

snippet: GetConnectionFromContext
