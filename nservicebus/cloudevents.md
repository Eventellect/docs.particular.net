[CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) is a [specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md) for describing event data in a common way. CloudEvents seeks to dramatically simplify event declaration and delivery across services, platforms, and beyond.

NServiceBus currently does not natively support CloudEvents.

We are currently capturing requirements to understand your needs regarding CloudEvents.
If you are interested in helping &#117;s shape how NServiceBus should support CloudEvents, drop &#117;s a comment in [this](https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/issues/5357) GitHub issue.
